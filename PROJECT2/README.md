# 🏠 House Price Prediction — Linear Regression

A machine learning project that predicts California house prices using Linear Regression, built with Python and scikit-learn.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project trains a supervised regression model on the **California Housing Dataset** (built into scikit-learn) to predict median house values based on demographic and geographic features. The workflow covers everything from data loading and EDA to model training, evaluation, feature importance analysis, and a log-transform improvement experiment.

---

## 🎯 Objective

> Train a Linear Regression model that accurately predicts house prices based on features such as income, house age, number of rooms, population, and location.

## 🧪 Project Workflow

The notebook follows a structured 14-step pipeline:

1. **Import Libraries**
2. **Load Dataset** from scikit-learn (no download required)
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** — `df.head()`, `df.describe()`
4. **Check Missing Values**
5. **Data Visualization** — distributions, correlations
6. **Feature & Target Split** — `X` and `y`
7. **Train/Test Split** — 80/20 with `random_state=42`
8. **Train Linear Regression Model**
9. **Make Predictions**
10. **Evaluate Model** — RMSE and R² Score
11. **Visualize Results** — Actual vs Predicted plot
12. **Feature Importance** — Coefficient analysis
13. **Model Improvement** — Log transformation on target variable
14. **Save Results** — Export predictions to CSV

## 📈 Model Performance

| Metric | Baseline Model | After Log Transform |
|---|---|---|
| **RMSE** | — | 0.2244 |
| **R² Score** | — | 0.6006 |

> Log-transforming the target variable (`np.log1p(y)`) was applied as a feature engineering technique to reduce skewness and improve model fit.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **`MedInc` (Median Income)** had the highest positive coefficient (~0.78), making it the strongest predictor of house price.
- **`AveBedrms`** showed a notable positive influence (~0.78), while **`AveRooms`** had a slight negative coefficient.
- Geographic features (`Latitude`, `Longitude`) contributed meaningfully, reflecting California's coastal price premiums.
